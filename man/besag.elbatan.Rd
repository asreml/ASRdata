\description{
This randomized complete block design experiment was carried out at
El BatÃ¡n, Mexico, by the International Center for Improvement of Maize
and Wheat (CIMMYT) for testing wheat varieties (\code{gen}) regarding their
ability to produce seeds (\code{yield}). The trial was carried in a single
location with three single-column (\code{col}) replicates and
fifty rows (\code{row}). A total of 50 treatments (\code{varieties}) were evaluated.
For further information refer to the paper mentioned below.
The dataset is available from the agridat package.
