\title{Oxide layers on silicon wafers}
\format{
data.frame
}
\usage{
semicond
}
\description{
In this dataset, the measurements correspond to thickness (\code{thick}) of
the oxide layer on silicon wafers. The wafers (\code{wafer}) were randomly
selected from eight different lots (\code{lot}), each having 25 wafers in
total. After the layer of oxide was deposited, the layerâ€™s thickness was
assessed at 3 randomly selected sites (\code{site}) within each wafer.
In addition, two different sources (\code{source}) of material are available
and can be compared statistically.
