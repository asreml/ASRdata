#' Raw phenotypic information for apricot dataset
#'
#' @description
#' The plant material consists of a F1 generation from a cross between cultivars
#' "Goldrich" and "Moniqui". The progeny is composed of 153 individuals
#' evaluated at the INRAE experimental field in southern France.
#' Only data for year 2006 is included here.
#'
#' Fruits were collected and divided into three homogenous (maturity) lots of
#' four fruits per genotype. Fruits were then measured for weight
#' (\code{F.Weight}), ground colour (\code{Hue.g}), ethylene (\code{Ethylene}),
#' refractive index (solid soluble content; \code{RI}), titratable acidity
#' (\code{TA}), glucose (\code{Glucose}), fructose (\code{Fructose}),
#' citric acid (\code{Citric.A.}), and malic acid (\code{Malic.A.}).
