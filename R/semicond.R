#' Oxide layers on silicon wafers
#'
#' @description
#' In this dataset, the measurements correspond to thickness (\code{thick}) of
#' the oxide layer on silicon wafers. The wafers (\code{wafer}) were randomly
#' selected from eight different lots (\code{lot}), each having 25 wafers in
#' total. After the layer of oxide was deposited, the layerâ€™s thickness was
#' assessed at 3 randomly selected sites (\code{site}) within each wafer.
#' In addition, two different sources (\code{source}) of material are available
#' and can be compared statistically.
