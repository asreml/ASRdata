#' Disease Resistance
#'
#' @description
#' This trial investigates the resistance of 12 varieties of a plant to a soil borne disease.
#' The trial was done in a glasshouse based on a randomized complete block design
#' (RCBD) with 10 blocks (\code{block}). Each of these blocks consisted in 24 pots (\code{pot}), with a single
#' plant per pot, which had randomly assigned one of the 12 varieties (\code{variety}) and one of the
#' two types (\code{disease}) of soil: healthy (H) or infected (D). Therefore, we have a 12 x 2 factorial
#' experiment with the two treatment (\code{trt}) factors: disease and variety. In this study,
#' the response variable corresponds to total leaf area (\code{leafarea}) of each plant (in cm).
