#' IQ scores of twins
#'
#' @description
#' This dataset contains the IQ scores (\code{iq}) of identical
#' (\code{monozygotic}) twins (\code{twin}) that were separated early in life
#' and reared apart. Univitelline twins are very important for genetic studies
#' because they share virtually identical genotype. The data corresponds to a
#' total of 32 pairs (\code{pair}) of twins where one of the members (twin = A)
#' was reared by their natural parent, and the other (twin = B) was reared by a
#' relative or other person.
